### CPSC 120

* **Lab 4**

    Lab 4 Part 1 was one of my favorite projects because it involves mathematical equations. It provided an opportunity to hone my skills in writing and defining functions. Using these simple and related functions helped me better grasp modular and efficient code design. Additionally, I liked doing the unit conversions, navigating from milliliters to teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and ultimately cups.

* **Lab 7**

    Lab 7 Part 2 was one of my favorite projects for me as it involves determining parking permissions based on days, hours, and minutes, which was enjoyable to me. This part of the lab required me to use if-statements and defining functions for specific streets, my favorite aspect of the process. I gained practical insights into coding rules for parking scenarios and handling complex if-statements. Successfully completing this challenging part left me feeling accomplished. 

* **Lab 11**

    Lab 11 Part 2 was one of my favorite programming projects due to its engaging implementation of a simple guessing game using C++. I liked designing the game logic within the `GameState` class and learned about incorporating randomness effectively with the `RandomSecretNumber` function. I learned that the code structure provided insight into managing game states and utilizing random number generation for interactive applications.
